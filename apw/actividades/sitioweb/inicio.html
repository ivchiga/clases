			<p>The 1140 grid fits perfectly into a 1280 monitor. On smaller monitors it becomes fluid and adapts to the width of the browser.</p>
			<p>Beyond a certain point it uses media queries to serve up a mobile 
version, which essentially stacks all the columns on top of each other 
so the flow of information still makes sense.</p>
			<p>Scrap 1024! Design once at 1140 for 1280, and with very little 
extra work, it will adapt itself to work on just about any monitor, even
 mobile.</p>

			<h2>Why 12 columns?</h2>
			<p>Twelve divides into even columns of two, three, four or six.</p>
			<p>Or into numerous uneven combinations like seven and five or five, four, three.</p>
			<p>The last example is as simple as three divs with the classes <code>.fivecol</code>, <code>.fourcol</code> and <code>.threecol</code></p>
			
			<h2>Mobile version</h2>
			<p>By mobile, I really mean smart phones. I'm not even attempting to 
support WAP phones or anything old like that. But it does work on 
devices that recognise 'handheld' in the style sheet media and/or media 
queries. With media queries you can even include x2 images for the 
iPhone 4 Retina Display.</p>
			
			<h2>Photoshop Template</h2>
			<p>Download a Photoshop template of <a href="http://download.cssgrid.net/1140_CccGrid_Template.psd" class="ongreenlink">the grid at 1140px here</a>. It's based on how it's displayed in WebKit, so it's actually 1133px, as all browsers round sub-pixels slightly differently.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class="fourcol">
			<h2>New computers, old computers, netbooks, tablets, smartphones, some feature phones.</h2>
			<p>So far I've tested it on a couple of MacBooks, an iMac, a PC 
laptop, an old PC, an Eee PC, an iPad, an iPhone 3G, an iPhone 4, a few 
Android phones, a Samsung Galaxy Tab, a BlackBerry and an older Nokia.</p>
			
			<h2>Browser support</h2>
			<p>It works perfectly in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE7 &amp; IE8.</p>
			<p>It works alright in IE6. IE6 doesn't support <code>max-width</code>,
 so the grid doesn't fix to 1140px. It spans the full width of the 
browser. Most people using IE6 probably don't have monitors with a 
resolution higher than 1280x1024 though. Images are also not restrained 
to the width of the column because of max-width. But the extra image is 
hidden, rather than breaking the layout.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> IE6 accounts for less than 1% of total traffic to <a href="http://www.catchingzebra.com/" class="ongreenlink">my blog</a>. Check your analytics.</p>

		<div class="fourcol last">
			<h2>Bigger gutters</h2>
			<p>Because it's all based off percentages, the gutters vary in size. But at full width the gutters are about 40px wide.</p>
			<h2>Images</h2>
			<p>If an image is smaller than the column it is contained in, it will
 be displayed at its original size. If it is larger then it will be 
shrunk to the width of the column. Don't define height and width of 
images inline, it'll break the proportions if they're scaled down.</p>
